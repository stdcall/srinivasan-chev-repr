// reason; `verified_by` (how the correction was checked) stays in the
// journal.

// formulas, so they are evaluated with the book's own definitions (GL, Ad,
// the reference helpers are not needed here) to read as in the book.

// "[56]": the objects and the list of references are not in this separate

// print "?" (the book's reference rule, applied here too).
